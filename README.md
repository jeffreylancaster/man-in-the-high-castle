# Man in the High Castle Datasets and Visualizations

Playing with Amazon X-ray data to go directly from X-ray files to d3 visualization(s).

Generally a playground of works in progress, but sharing regardless.

## Visualizations

- Supercut Duration - [Preview](https://jeffreylancaster.github.io/man-in-the-high-castle/duration-character/) [[<>]](https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/man-in-the-high-castle/blob/master/duration-character/index.html)
- Scenes by Character - [Preview](https://jeffreylancaster.github.io/man-in-the-high-castle/scenes-character/) [[<>]](https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/man-in-the-high-castle/blob/master/scenes-character/index.html)
